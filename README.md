# Machine Learning with Python - Final Project

This repository presents the final project of the Machine Learning (ML) with Python from IBM course on Coursera. The objective is to evaluate different ML algorithms for a binary classification task and, finally, to evaluate them. The database is about loans and a dataset is used to train the models and then another dataset to verify their performance. In addition, a brief analysis of data, data cleaning and feature engineering is made.
The algorithms used were: K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and to check their accuracy the following metrics were used: Jaccard, F1-Score and Log Loss.
